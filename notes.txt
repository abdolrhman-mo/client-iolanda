- mohssen => error when accessing orders if the user is not the admin

make orderService and orderThunk more organized and make the code more readable














mohsen:

authService.ts, fetchUserData, unautharized ('/api-auth/{id}/')
authService.ts, updateUserName, unautharized ('/api-auth/{id}/')
fetch orderItems and most of apis don't work when not admin
buyItNow not working because it doesn't create a guest order
