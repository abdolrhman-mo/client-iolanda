- mohssen => error when accessing orders if the user is not the admin

make orderService and orderThunk more organized and make the code more readable














mohsen:

authService.ts, fetchUserData, unautharized ('/api-auth/{id}/')
authService.ts, updateUserName, unautharized ('/api-auth/{id}/')
fetch orderItems and most of apis don't work when not admin
buyItNow not working because it doesn't create a guest order



if not admin
GET http://localhost:8000/orders/users-view/ 403 (Forbidden)
solu: bec. of verification. the email must be activated
0.



errors

GET http://localhost:8000/api-auth/1/ 401 (Unauthorized) 
(it works in swagger but it doesn't work in fetch)

POST http://localhost:8000/orders/users-view/ 500 (Internal Server Error)
server => Field 'id' expected a number but got <django.contrib.auth.models.AnonymousUser object at 0x0000023C134D8F80>.

when creating an order:
  guest order
    - u shouldn't need token nor user id
    - it sends res w order data 
  normal order 
    - u can use token
    - then the order res comes including user id

Mohsen todo list 
- remove varification




Edits I made 

1- if (request.user.authenticated) user = request.user : user = None
    to allow non authenticated users to create orders
    but now it still needs order_items to create order 
    and the unauthenticated user doesn't have order_items assotaited with him

2- /orders/users-view/{id}/ gives 200 but it doesn't edit anything
    i did this using partial_update function in OrderViewSet
    then i updated orderSerializer to accept nested data to be able to send user: { first_name: 'abdo' }
    and i did this by creating update function in orderSerializer
    and inside the servializer i removed adderss object and replaced it with address fields(addressText: 'test', country: 'egypt')
    because in models the it was address fields not address object(address: {addressText: 'test'})

3- GET http://localhost:8000/api-auth/1/ 401 (Unauthorized)
    i solved this error by making TokenAuthentication the default authentication class for user viewset
